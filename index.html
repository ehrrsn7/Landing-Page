        About Me
    </h1>
    <p>
        If you know me you would simply have to admit I'm a fun, loving guy who tells way too many dad jokes.
        I love to take pictures, play Claude Debussy on the piano, go on runs, code new software, play video games, and on and on. 
    </p>
    <p>
        I am a hard worker and a great team member. One of my most distinguishable attributes is making sincere connections with those that I meet. I love working on projects, and I make sure requirements are met in a timely manner. 
    </p>
    <p>
        I am very involved in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints. I believe it is the most true thing I have learned about in my entire life. I served in the Brazil, Salvador Mission for the church, which is located in the state of Bahia, Brazil, also I speak fluent portuguese.
